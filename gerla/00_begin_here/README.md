# Preliminary information

> [!NOTE]
> In the following, I will ofter refer to a `storm` server. This is the server where we at the [NIN SBL lab](https://nin.nl/research-groups/keysers/social-brain-lab/) run our analyses. Take it as the generic name for your own remote linux server.

## An opinionated list of the best MRI viewer

- [MRIcroGL](https://github.com/rordenlab/MRIcroGL) : probably the best for creating beautiful 2D images

- [Mango](https://mangoviewer.com/) : very good choice for a hassle-free interaction between 2D views and surface renderings. It also produces shareable HTML pages with an embedded viewer.

- [Surfice](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/surfice/) : great fancy rendering of surfaces (although the projection of blobs/activations look better in Mango IMHO)

- [itk-SNAP](http://www.itksnap.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php) : pro-graded image viewer with easy access to lots of information about the image

## Use LLMs to ask questions about this repo!
As this repo grows, it can be difficult to find the information you are looking for - or something you previously read in one of the pages and don't remember where it is.

Fortunately, we live in the era of LLM chatbots, and they can help us with that.

To make a github repo digestible by an LLM, you can use [gitingest](https://gitingest.com/). Simply replace `github.com` with `gitingest.com` in the repo you want to ask questions about - [example here](https://gitingest.com/leonardocerliani/GUTS_fmri_preproc/tree/main/TUT) - and then copy/paste the resulting text into your favourite LLM (e.g. Google AI Studio) and ask questions. Try for instance to ask the example above the following question: _"How do I convert into nifti a PAR/REC file whose acquisition has been aborted before the expected ending?"_


## Setting up your account on storm to work with fsl
I don't know whether we will really manage to make a tutorial. For the moment, this is (aims to be) a collection of short snippets for dealing with focused issues.

Most of what is done with nii images here will be in bash using FSL - and occasionally ANTs. In order to use fsl on storm you need to add a few lines to the `~/.bash_profile` in your home directory (that's what the `~` stands for). If this file does not yet exists, just create it. Then add the following lines.

```bash
# FSL Setup
FSLDIR=/usr/local/fsl

PATH=${FSLDIR}/share/fsl/bin:${PATH}
export FSLDIR PATH
. ${FSLDIR}/etc/fslconf/fsl.sh
```

This adds fsl to the path, and runs a few environmental variables used by fsl.

To check that now fsl is available for you to play with, open a new terminal or `source .bash_profile` and type `fslmaths`. If you see lots of text coming out, congratulations. You are ready to go.

## fslview in a box (i.e. Docker)
Since you work with brain images, you need to have a program to inspect them.

fsl nowadays comes equipped with an image viewer called fsleyes. However on storm (and apparently on this Ubuntu version) fsleyes does not want to work.

The solution I devised was to create a docker with a previous lightweight viewer, called fslview. 

To use it, you need to be part of the docker group on storm (ask me). Once that is taken care of, proceed as follows:

- open an X environment - e.g. access storm using x2goclient
- go to the folder where the image you want to visualize is present
- type in a terminal `fslview_MNI.sh [myimage]` replacing of course myimage with the actual name of the image you want to visualize (can be a nii or nii.gz, you don't need to specify the extension)

If you want to use this on your local computer - provided that you have Docker installed - just clone my [repo](https://github.com/leonardocerliani/fslview_in_a_box) and follow the instructions. (NB: not tested on windoze)


## Sample data
Some examples require actual MRI data (not surprisingly), which is usually heavy to load on github. However, I assume that you have access to MRI data yourself. Therefore, to keep the repo lightweight, I will place in each folder a `data_example` directory which shows the data structure I used for that example, so that you can replace it with your own data. The script `generate_data_example.sh` is what I use to generate the `data_example` directory.

In the future, I might think about having a standard dataset that can be uploaded here or in some open repository such as [Neurovault](https://neurovault.org/).

## Exploring brain images in RStudio (yes, really)
Having to switch all the time between terminal / VS code and x2goclient to inspect the images can be annoying. 

Recently I discovered that you can open a viewer inside RStudio! Check the documentation [here](https://johnmuschelli.com/papayaWidget/). At some point I will put some demo R code.

NB: this method does _not_ produce a simple static image, it opens a _full-fledged image browser_, and _that_ is why it is cool. 

## Accessing storm from VS code (and w/out password)
Please refer to [this page](https://github.com/leonardocerliani/machines_setup/blob/main/VS_code_ssh_port_fw.md). 

This is particularly useful also to know how to use RStudio, Jupyter lab/notebooks and other services running on storm _in your local browser_.

**Important note**: accessing storm in the way described in that page - instead of your dear x2goclient - is not just _'cool'_: remote desktops like x2goclient need to download _a lot_ of data every second - i.e. the entire screen - even if you are just moving the mouse around on the remote desktop.

This means a sluggish (to say the least) user experience and pointless stress on the server, which results - to use an expression of our days - in a huge carbon footprint.

On the other hand the ssh port:localhost:port methods described in the page above need to transfer a tiny fraction of the data with respect to remote desktop, and provide a great lag-free user experience.

Finally, the password-less method is also more secure - exactly because you do not need to enter your password. Indeed it's the only way you can use GitHub nowadays.

The choice is yours.
